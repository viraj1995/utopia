  Here is a natural way to improve your mood... <break time="1s"/>

advice_list:
  - Listen to music that makes you feel good.
  - Immerse yourself in nature, and take in the sounds and peacefulness. The change of scenery will help improve your mood.
  - Go for a walk. Sometimes just getting out of the house and moving around can greatly help improve your mood.
  - Sing! Belt it out till you're feeling better.
  - Dance! Try dancing like no one's is watching.
  - Clean and organize your home. It can help you refocus and give you a sense of control. It can also tune out the negative voice in your head, and at the end, you will feel accomplished, and can look around and feel pride.
  - Take note of all the small things you've accomplished today.
  - Draw and paint what you're feeling. Sometimes just expressing your emotions on a canvas can be very grounding.
  - Write little positivity notes to yourself, and leave them where you'll see them.
  - Play your favorite video game. If you develop a “gameful” mindset, you’ll be more motivated and resilient in the face of everyday challenges.
  - Eat healthy. Although nothing is definitive, there's evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon and tuna, and folic acid, such as spinach and avocado, could help ease depression.
  - Take your time solving a jigsaw puzzle. The sense of accomplishment and content with every little bit of piece you add can go a long way.
  - Play with your pet, or get a pet if you don't have one. This could help reduce stress and anxiety by easing loneliness and encouraing exercise and playfulness.
  - Immerse yourself in another world by reading a book. Being able to unplug and lose yourself in another world and another story can bring you so much peace of mind.
  - Stay organized by sticking to a routine. Having your routines organized can give you a sense of control over your life.
  - Make your bed in the morning. It might be a small accomplishment, but it sets the tone for the entire day. Extensive studies have shown that it can improve mood and productivity.
  - Take a warm, comforting bubble bath. Being physically relaxed can have a positive impact on your mind.
  - Exercise or do some yoga. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways.
  - Help someone else by volunteering. Making someone else's day a little better can instantly improve your mood, and can go a long way for both parties.
  - Call a friend and hang out. Just being around others can greatly improve your mood.
  - Go to your favorite coffee shop and enjoy a nice cup of coffee.
  - Practice Mindfulness Meditation. It can lower stress, and is great for your mental and physical health.
  - Accompany someone to the movies, a concert, or a small get-together.
  - Vist a museum. Hanging out around a museum for a couple hours can be an emotionally satisfying experience.
  - Meet new people by taking a class or joining a club.
  - Re-arrange the furniture in a room in your house. The change of scenery should help.
  - Set goals, such as make a to-do list for this week. Setting goals is important to fight depression. Start small. Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day. As you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.
